<h1>Readme</h1>

<p>
    To compile the project the following has to be done:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Unzip the project file</li>
    <li>Open a commandline tool and move to the unzipped folder</li>
    <li>Run the "ant" command from the commandline, this should compile and run the program (tested on linux and windows)</li>
    <li>The "ant clean" command will clean and remove the compiled files</li>
    <li>If the project is already compiled you can use the "ant run" command to run</li>
    <li>If the program is not working you might have to update your graphics card to the newest drivers, and/or download the<br>
        JOGL natives for your system and put them in the lib folder (windows, linux and mac os natives should already be there, <br> but we have only tested for linux and windows). </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    The mandelbrot set should show up on the screen.<br>
    There are two files showing our recording functionality under the documents folder. One GIF and one MP4 file.
